I have developed COWIN Vaccine Notifier Application using Flutter and Dart.

This Mobile Application is currently meant for the users to create an alert notification for Covid Vaccine slots availability based on their Location(PIN code), Vaccine type, Dose Number, and Age Group.

In case if there are no Slots available for the user inputted details, an alert will be created by the application for the inputted details. Whenever there are open slots available for booking users will be notified with the help of the notification regarding the availability of the slots.

I would like to thank Pawan Kumar and Max Millan for creating astounding Flutter and Dart tutorials
